How It Works

  1. Capture input via button presses or key events.
  2. Update display dynamically as users enter numbers or operations.
  3. Evaluate expressions using JavaScript logic, with checks to prevent invalid states (e.g., division by zero).
  4. Reset or clear inputs to return to the initial state when needed.

Why This Project?

  1. Ideal for beginners learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI feedback.
  2. Demonstrates best practices in structuring a small but functional web app.
  3. A solid foundation to build upon with extended features like advanced operations, history tracking, or styling enhancements.
